## Addressing

The WIM is designed to be completely address-space agnostic.  It will come equipped to use several common address-spaces and new ones can be easily created, which can include almost any printable unicode character.

There are two basic categories of *item* (the base addressable unit) in the WIM: those that are *signers* (with keypairs who can sign things) and those that are not.  Only signers can create other items (both signers and non-singers).  They use their place in the item address-space to create each their own unique namespace, allowing any signer items to create and address as many items as they want.  How exactly that is addressed may vary across different addresses schemes, but can take the somewhat familiar form of a "site" with various documents it contains:

	@some.domain.com/some/particular/document
	
A site is a signer, represented by the domain portion of this address.  The document it references is (in this case) not a signer, but a thing that is signed and referenced entirely within the namespace of of `some.domain.com`.  Keep in mind that in the WIM, the second part (the "path" portion) means nothing without the first (the "site" or signer portion).  The entire string (in the above example) is required to fully represent the address of that item.

# At-Domain Addresses

The WIM will maintain backwards-compatibility with the Domain Name System (DNS) and the *email* address-space derived from it, giving us some important organizational concepts that are familiar:  *sites* and *users*.  Not unlike in the real web of today, a site does not represent a particular server, but a collection of data that can be accessed at some various location(s).  Sites can in turn create users, giving a piece of the namespace that they hold to their user:

	@site.co.uk
	@facebook.com
	user@site.tld
	some.user@some.acme.net
	
As shown above, though we are maintaining backwards-compatability with email addresses, we are not doing so with the URL scheme, so in the WIM "At-Domain" space, sites (as well as users) also contain the `@` symbol. So all addresses in this space include this marker, whether site, user or thing.

The various variants of this standard address-space will be accessible through the WIM if background services are available for such, including: `.onion` addresses, `.i2p` addresses, alternate DNS roots, etc.  These are all collectively referred to as "domained" addresses, that are compatible (even marginally) with the official DNS system.  An item may have multiple addresses, and therefore be accessible on separate namespaces.

Since it is only the "site" and "user" portions of the existing email address space that we are maintaining backwards compatibility with, we are not bound by any of the other limits of the standard `URL` scheme, and sites, users, and other types of signers are free to create addresses in their "path" space including any characters supported:

	some.domain.com/ËèàËèâËèäËèãÂû¥ÂûµÂû∂.whatever#3_funky
	users.can.to@blahmail.net/‚´±‚´≤‚´≥blah_blah_‚´¥‚´µ‚´∂‚´∑.üññ

So far all these addresses have pointed to *items*, discreet addressable units.  However, in the WIM, no matter what address space you are using, you can directly address individual components of items.  To accomplish this, one character is reserved from all possible address-spaces.

### Reference Character

An *address*, by itself, is a "reference" to a particular item.  The reference character is needed entirely so that individual parts of an item may be referenced directly in a manner that's able to be easily typed on a keyboard.  This is the sole printable character that is disallowed in addresses.  If an address leads to an item as a whole, the character is unused.  It is required only at the end of an address to signify that what follows is a reference to an *item component*.

Any of the four component types may be referenced in this way so that one certain *relation*, some particular *manifest*, *content* block, or *summary* may be addressed specifically.  To signify which type of component is being referenced, other easily printable symbols are used, one to signify each type.  These characters are not restricted by the WIM from other places in addresses (though various address-spaces may), though if the reference character isn't followed by one of them, and then the rest of an item component reference, then that should be considered malformed.  These characters are:

* manifest	`!`
* relation	`~`
* content	`;`
* summary	`^`

What follows the the pair of characters (which itself immediately follow an address) is the identifier of the item component in question.

	@somedomain.com/some/item.or/another\~




Internally, the WIM uses the `IP address` namespace (both IPv4 and IPv6) to index all the hosts it knows about and meets, using the WIM structure to store and index any data about each host needed for routing or anything else.

Re



The standard `DNS` system is used as the primary initial namespace of the WIM, which is backwards-compatable with existing email addresses to existing email system.  While the WIM is URL-aware, it's primary address-space is slightly different for all items other than users, though the format should seem familiar, and is still derived from the core existing DNS addressing system.

Though the existing DNS system has quite a few limitations and restrictions, the WIM itself has VERY few restrictions on what can be used as a valid address.

.  Though backwards-compatable with the email system, WIM addresses for other items than users, such as `sites` or various other items that don't represent users or machines themselves, don't match exactly to existing `URL` specs, though the WIM will be aware of that address-space.

The WIM will also come equipped to use the TOR `.onion` address-space if available system services for delivery are present.

While `host` items use IP addresses, which always refer to a specific computer somewhere (and may be renamed or merged as IP addresses of these actual hosts change), these are intended for internal use, for routing and storing information about hosts.  Users and other items likely want to be accessible from other hosts than that specified, allowing them to take advantage of the WIM's internal peer routing system for redundancy 



The uddb system is flexible enough to allow for almost *any* address space, and can be extended as such.  The only characters not allowed in an address are white spaces and control characters.  Low order control characters (below U+0020) are used heavily in the item format and the protocol to avoid having reserved printable characters, since these codepoints are just lying around anyway and can be represented in a single byte (in the default of UTF-8).

The primary namespace of the uddb is based on the traditional email namespace, which is in turn based on the domain name system.  We are using that system as it is, taking over the role of email for messages sent as such, but adding a path to the end of that email, allowing each user to create arbitrary items inside their own personal namespace, in which everything is addressable by a unique address which is is prefixed by the address of its publisher, that user having control over their own namespace.  The user addressing system in uddb is intended to take over that of the current email address space.  The uddb operates on the *same ports* as an SMTP/MTA server, detecting actual such servers and automatically importing and exporting emails into simple message objects.  Every domain addressable address that is not a user is to some other kind of item (a document OR a program) and contains a *path*.  Paths can be completely arbitrary, can be generated automatically based on its type and content, or chosen by the user upon creation of an item.  Note that addresses, for the most part can contain any valid unicode character, excepting the specific use of `@` , `/` , and `.` with all other codepoints being valid.

	üôá@this.that/music.dead.79.denver
	joshua@readingrainbow.space/chess.432

However, the system can support other namespaces and does so to manage *hosts*.  Each physical computer, with an IP address (including localhost) that the system communicates with gets an item generated to represent it.  These *host items* use the IP address namespace directly and are used to store key information, connection history, domain data, and anything else.

### Restricted Characters

In an effort to allow for easily human-readable references to extend into the various components of an item consistently across different address-spaces, there must be some printable characters that are used to signify the end of an address and the beginning of a reference to a part of the item.  Since there are exactly four types of component for an item, there are just so many characters that are restricted from addresses at large:

* `~` - 
* `;`
* ```
* `^`
 

### Users

The address itself will indicate some things about what kind of item this is, if it has a username before the `@` then it is of class `Account`, and if it begins with the `@` then it is a `Server`, and so if no path follows, then we have an item representing that user themselves, and is the basis for communicating with them.

	joe@acme.com
	@github.net
	help@mycompany.com
	joe@whatever.domain.tld

#### Paths

Paths denote any item that is not a User.  The `/` character has no meaning in the path and can be included, as well as any other valid unicode codepoint.  The `.` character is used as the default separater.  The optional ending numberal on any non `User` item is used in the back-end by some `Item` subclasses to automatically create items, but when naming items manually, none is needed.

	joshualibrarian@github.com/libnet
	@foo.net/word.adj.zestilly
	account@server.ie.domain.tld/some.kind.of.path.4

#### Ranges

A certain part of an item can be addressed directly by appending a *range* onto an item address using the square-bracket `[]` syntax.  An item may have any number of *content*  portions, and each has its own name which can be referenced in the brackets optionally followed by a range or further specification of the reference:

	@foo.net/essay.34[fig.4]
	account@server.ie.domain.tld/some.kind.of.path.4[p.4-6]
	joshua@fee.com/my.cool.new.book[chapter.4:p32-45]
	me@you.we.net/my.cool.video[3:15-6:33]

Different kinds of content use different kinds of ranges, which are defined in the items that represent those file types.  When addressing a relation, that address builds on the address of the item that is the *"subject"* of the relation, and adding the creator of the relation and the id *unique to that user in this file*.  This mechanism can be used by Item subclass authors to communicate directly with their application in just about any way, passing data directly from one instance of that particular item to another.


#### Relations

Another way that addresses can refer to only a portion of an item is by referencing a certain *relation* of that item by using the `;` syntax followed by the unique identifier of the relation relative to the item.  Both range and relation cannot be present in one address, though a relation can refer to only a part of its subject such is not reflected in the address of the relation.

	@foo.net/essay.about.something;some@guy.who.commented#3
	@foo.net/essay.about.something;some@other.commenter#524
	@bobross.love;professor@fancy.edu#3[p.3-4]
	
Note that when a range is used after a relation address, it means that this reference refers to a part *of that relation*, which implies that there is some content (either a literal, an object, or both) associated with it, or there would be no part to refer to.
	
#### References 
 
A reference, meaning an address that refers to a specific location, to a user, or to an item, or to a relation of an item, or to a portion of a relation of an item, in addition to the preceeding elements, can include an "as entered" portion.  This ammendment, designated with the parentheses `()`, is used primarily to display to the user how this reference was actually entered (if it was entered via text that is, if it was entered via a mouseclick there may be no as entered).  Word that are synonyms can yield the same sememe (meaning) object that is used to do the actual linking, and the as entered text shows which of potentially many words (or phrases) was used to call up this item in this instance.  This data will additionally prove useful as the system matures to help make text processing better and better, so wherever possible, these references should be maintained.

The `Reference` class encapusates a reference, and is used extensively throughout the `Item` class, because if item variables were stored directly as `Item` objects, then we would be loading a whole lot more items into memory which we may not actually need as we're processing these and loading items off disk.  Using the `Reference`, we know what the address of the item is, so can load it if we need it.  It also provides a place to keep the as-entered portion.  It can also store a literal string, which is used in some cases.

In cases like the as entered text, if you need to enter a parentheses into it, it can be escaped with an ESC character (U+001B).  This is used as an escape character anywhere escape characters are needed in this project (almost like they were made for the purpose or something ü§î).
